         <p>Ayyappan, also known as Dharmasastha and Manikandan, is the Hindu deity<br> of truth and righteousness. According to Hindu theology, he is described <br>as the son of Shiva and Vishnu in the form of Mohini, <br>thus representing a bridge between Shaivism and Vaishnavism</p>

    <p>The Sanskrit word Thatwamasi translates to "You Are That" or "Thou Art That" in English. It's a central concept in Hindu philosophy, particularly in the Advaita Vedanta tradition. It's used to describe the relationship between the individual self and the ultimate reality or absolute. </p>
